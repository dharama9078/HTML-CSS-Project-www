    <p>The world wide web is an information system that enables <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Media_(communication)">content sharing over the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet">Internet </a>through user-friendly ways meant to appeal to users beyond<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_technology"> IT</a> specialists and hobbyists. It allows documents and oter <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_resource" > web resorces </a> to be accessed over the Internet according to specific rules of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP"> HTTP. </a>
    </p> 
    
    <p> The Web was invested by English computer scientist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee"> Tim_Berners-Lee</a> while at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CERN">CERN</a> in 1989 and opened to the public in 1991. it was conceived as a <q>universal linked informatin system </q> Documents and other media content are made available to the network through <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CERN">web servers</a> and can be accessed by program such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_browser" >web browsers.</a> </a> Servers and resources on the World Wide Web are identified and located through characters string called URLs.</a></p>
    <p> The original and the still very common document type is a web page formatted in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML">HyperText Markup Language</a> (HTML). This markup language supports <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plain_text"> plain text,<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_image"> image</a> embedded <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video"> video and<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audio_signal"> audio</a>contents,and scripts that implement complex user interaction .The HTML language also supports <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperlink">hyperlinks</a>which provides immediate access to other web resources.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_navigation"> Web navigation,</a>or web sufring,is the common practice of fallowing such hyperlinks across multiple websites.</p>
    <h2>History</h2><hr>
    <p>The Web was invented by English copmuter scientist Tim Berners Lee while working at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CERN"> CERN</a>. He was motivated by the problem of updating,and data files in tha large and constantly changing organization,as well as distributing them to collaborators outside CERN.In his design ,Berners-Lee dismissed the common <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_(data_structure)"> tree structure</a> approach ,used for instance in the existing CERNDOC  documentation system and in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_filesystem"> Unix filesystem</a>, as well as approaches that relied in tagging files with keywords,as in the VAX/NOTES system.Insted he adopted concepts he had put into practice with his private <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ENQUIRE">ENQUIRE</a> system(1980) built at CERN.When he became aware of Ted Nelson's hypertext model(1965),in which documents can be linked in unconstrained ways through hyperlink associated with <q>hot spots</q> embeded in the text,it helped to confirm the validity of his concept.</p>
